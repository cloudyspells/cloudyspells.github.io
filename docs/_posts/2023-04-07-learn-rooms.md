Microsoft Learn Rooms has been announced this week and it seems to be a very
exciting new blended learning experience for anyone looking to develop cloud
skills in supportive environment with peers and experts.

Rooms not only consist of training, but also discussions and office hours
sessions to ask questions to experts, Microsoft Certified Trainers and MVP's
and asynchronous possibilities to connect. It is a community experience
resembling a classroom experience in the sense that you also learn from the
questions and discusions of your peers. This helps in gaining insights in to
many practical use cases and build your network. All from the comfort of your
own home or wherever you choose to connect.
